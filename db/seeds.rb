# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
Restaurant.create({
  name: "Pommes",
  address: "KÃ¶ln",
  category: "french"
})


# "chinese", "italian", "japanese", "french", "belgian"
